# LABORATORIO_DI_PROGRAMMAZIONE
This is a project that implements the A* algorithm with a graphical representation made in SFML. The map and the start/end points are editable. The end point can be decided dynamically by the mouse click. When the program is launched the map is displayed, and the character stands on the starting block. When the A* algorithm is done executing, if it finds a path, it will show it by moving the character after a few seconds, until it reaches the goal. Otherwise, it will print an error to the console.
